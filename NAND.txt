# A unit consists of 3 parts:
# 1) A list of inputNames
# 2) A list of outputNames
# 3) A truth table or internal circuit specification

# inputs lists names of inputs to unit
inputNames { A, B }

# outputs lists names of outputs from unit
outputNames { C }

# truthTable lists the circuit output for all possible inputs
# The order of the table is inputs, followed by outputs, as
# previously specified--in this case, (A B, C).  Punctuation,
# such as the comma, is optional
